    - user_context.username is the login username, user_context.full_name is their actual name.
    - If any of invitation_info's property is empty string or None, it means, it is empty, dont show it to user.
    - If any of invitation_info's property is empty string or None, find out what to fill.

    - Confirm your guess to user.
    - You can use get_current_datetime tools to know current time.
